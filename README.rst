Purpose
*******

Mind Map XBlock is a pluggable extension to the Open edX platform that allows course creators to build a learning experience in which students can visualize and easily edit Mind Maps within a course unit.

It leverages the `jsMind`_ open source javascript library to visualize and edit mind maps on htmls canvas and svg.

.. _jsMind: https://github.com/hizzgdev/jsmind

The Mind Map Xblock component can be used to build and display a mind map for learners to explore a particular concept, or to have learners build their own Mind map which can then be graded by course staff members.

This Xblock has been created as an open source contribution to the Open edX platform and has been funded by the Unidigital project 2023. 

`XBlock`_ is the Open edX component architecture for building custom learning interactives.

Fields
======
- **Display name (String)**: Name of the component.
- **Is a static mindmap? (Boolean)**: If this option is set to True, the course creator will provide the Mind map and learners will only be able to explore them but not edit them.  If set to False, the course creator can provide an initial version of the Mind map that learners will be able to modify and submit for grading.
- **Mindmap**: Instructors will be able to use a visual editor to create the mind map.


Using the jsMind interface
**************************
Each Mind Map can be explored or edited using the mouse or with keyboard shortcuts.

Using the mouse
===============
- Click on a node to select it.
- Double-click on a node to change the legend and click elsewhere to apply the changes.
- Drag the node to move it to a different part of the structure.
- Click the circle next to one node to expand or collapse its child nodes.

With the keyboard
=================
- ``Enter``: Create a new brother node for the selected node.
- ``Ctrl + Enter``: Create a new child node for the selected node.
- ``F2``: Edit the legend for the selected node and hit Enter to apply the changes.
- ``Delete``: Delete the selected node.
- ``Space``: Expand or collapse any children of the selected node.

Course instructors can provide a grade for each submitted Mind Map in a course, by accessing the grading interface directly from the LMS view.


Experimenting with this Xblock in the Workbench
************************************************
You can see the Mind Map in action in the XBlock Workbench. Running the Workbench requires having docker running.

.. code:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:eduNEXT/xblock-mindmap
    cd xblock-mindmap
    virtualenv -p python3.8 venv && source venv/bin/activate
    make upgrade
    make install
    make dev.run

Once the process is done, you can interact with the Mind Map XBlock in the Workbench by navigating to http://localhost:8000

For details regarding how to deploy this or any other XBlock in the Open edX platform, see the `installing-the-xblock`_ documentation.
